### R1D2 
**Today's Progress**: Making progress on Ruby's Object Oriented Programming curriculum @microverseinc online school. Started project 3 (Intermediate Ruby) with milestone 1 and 2 for the tic tac toe project. With my coding Partner Dannison, we submitted milestone 1 (enviroment creation) for code for review.

**Thoughts:** I am loving Ruby OOP. Code academy material is great. Taking notes like crazy.

### R1D1 
**Today's Progress**: completed fixes for my ruby project 2 @microverseinc online school. Fixed enumerable methods #my_all, #my_none, #my_any and #my_inject. submitted code for review. now more relaxed and waiting for my code feedback.

**Thoughts:** Since I am learning how to work with rubocop, it was a little struggle to make rubocop happy and fix cyclomatic and complexity rules.
